A connection is simply a preffered distance between one another
Too far apart and they will be attracted, too close together and they will repel

Could use  F = -(1/x + x - 2)  as the force formula
This follows the spring formula F=-kx for large values and for small values the force increases rapidly as distance approaches zero

Something like y=x-d is not possible because the distance between the points cannot be negative




Force producer which keeps the angle between edges the same as how they started

Someone applied the particle-spring method to create a good softbody sim

Apply damping force better
Have the damping force inside of the softbody rather than an extenal force applied to each particles velocity
Have the springs themselves causes this damping force, as a spring changes size, apply a force in the opposite direction
This means if a spring was increasing in size due to kinetic energy, a force would apply in the opposite direction

Also add deformability
If a spring extends too far it will permantently change its length

Friction?
Particle collision with springs

Try out different softbody types likes ropes (with fixed points)
Also this allows for an easy double, triple etc pendulum for my reinforcement learner to balance
